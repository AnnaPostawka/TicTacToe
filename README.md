## AI algorithm

Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning

## Configuration options

- Player 1: human/computer - if computer:

  - Depth of a Minimax algorithm
  - Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta pruning
- Player 2: human/computer - if computer:

  - Depth of a Minimax algorithm
  - Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta pruning
- Size of the board: 3x3 - 10x10
- Length of a winning sequence (e.g. 3 in a row on a 5x5 board)

## Further development

- Draw - the game currently ends only if one player wins or there are no empty squares. It should also end when neither player can no longer win.
- GUI
- Basic and advanced mode - basic would have a simpler configuration, only with the type of players and the size of the board.
